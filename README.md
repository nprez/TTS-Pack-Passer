# TTS-Pack-Passer
A tool for Tabletop Simulator to help with drafting games such as Magic: The Gathering.

It can handle up to 3 packs queued at once, and automatically moves packs along as they're taken.

Press the red button to pass the pack in your hand and shuffle it.
Press the green button to draw the next pack.
